- How do I approach designing software?

As a developer, this class definitely pushed and improved my skills. Throughout the course, there was a ton of learning and implementing new aspects/features which we haven't worked with before, and it was not easy, but programming never is "just easy". I want to say that it definitely helped increase my ability to debug and persevere through a problem, but that's only true for particular assignments where I was able to get the code to function as intended. I tried my best to follow each tutorial part section by section so that when it came time to run the whole program it was working properly. This worked most of the time for the assignments in this course.

- How do I approach developing programs?

Working in a 3D environment required a new plan of attack and strategies for sure. I've had a few years of experience using 3D modeling tools such as Inventor and SolidWorks, so it was pretty easy to get used to the placement and configuration to separate meshes. Since we weren't working with whole numbers but decimals, I tried my best to actually open a 3D modeling program and create shapes on there so that I could transfer them easily to the OpenGL Program. This definitely assisted quite a bit in getting the meshes implemented to create whole features. I just wish I was able to get the lighting and mesh textures down as easily as the coordinate and placement of the objects.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can greatly assist me in reaching my goals in the future. I don't know how relevant OpenGL and other graphics visualizations will be, but the knowledge and skill of being able to create working programs will be extremely beneficial in the field of cybersecurity and software development. Just having a general idea of how to implement and work through problems is extremely useful in a career path, and it's a skill that will continuously be tried and tested in the future.
